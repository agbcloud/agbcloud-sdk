- **R**: R statistical computing environment.

## Examples

### Basic Execution
Comprehensive example demonstrating execution in all supported languages.

<<< ./main.py

### Caching Results
Demonstrates how to implement client-side caching for deterministic code execution results to save costs and reduce latency.

<<< ./caching.py

### Concurrency
Demonstrates how to execute multiple code tasks in parallel using threading for high-throughput scenarios.

<<< ./concurrency.py

### Security Best Practices
Demonstrates security best practices, including input validation and sanitization for untrusted code.

<<< ./security.py

### Multiple Results Scenarios
Demonstrates scenarios where code execution returns multiple results, including multiple display() calls, charts, and mixed output types.

<<< ./multiple_results_demo.py
